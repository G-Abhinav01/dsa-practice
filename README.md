## 🌱 Routine & Best Practices

1.  **Consistency is Key:** Dedicate regular time slots (e.g., 1-2 hours daily) for study and practice.
2.  **Understand, Don't Memorize:** Focus on the underlying concepts, problem-solving patterns, and various approaches.
3.  **Solve, Then Optimize:** First, aim for a working solution (brute force if necessary), then analyze its complexity and optimize.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** Write custom test cases, including edge cases.
5.  **Explain Your Solution:** Try to explain your thought process and solution aloud or to a peer. This reinforces understanding.
6.  **Review & Revise:** Periodically revisit problems you've solved. Try to re-solve them from scratch or find alternative solutions.
7.  **Use the Debugger:** Learn to effectively use your IDE's debugger to trace execution and understand how your code behaves.
8.  **Don't Get Stuck:** If you're stuck on a problem for more than 30-45 minutes, look at hints or the solution, understand it, and then try to implement it yourself.
